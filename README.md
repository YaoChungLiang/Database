# Database
This repo is for recording what I have learned and created along course journey.

## Tools
SQLite3, MySQL, Microsoft AZURE, AsterixDB, SQL++ 

# Intro
1. HW1. It helps me to understand basic manipulations of a simple database system.
2. Hw2. I created four tables ```Flights, Carriers, Months, Weekdays``` and created several complicated queires to efficiently get the answer from the interactions between these tables.
3. Hw3. The question set is same as HW2 but we used the Microsoft Azure SQL server to practice advance SQL and the speed is much faster than my computer.
4. HW4. We learned to design my own database system based on customer's spec and turn it into a E/R diagram shown below. And I transformed a E/R diagram to my database system by sql queries. We also learned how to apply Functional Dependency Theory to decompose a complicated table into several smaller tables. (Doesn't need to be BCNF (boyce codd normal form) everytime.)

5. HW5. We evaluted the properties of transactions and learned to apply 2PL (2 phase locking) to write transaction statements that would be used in an application.

6. HW6. We learned to write queries over semi-structured data model which is very different from the way of conventional relation database model. So we user NoSQL databse system(AsterixDB) and data in JSON to learn.
