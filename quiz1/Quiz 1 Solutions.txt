CSE 414 - Quiz 1 Solutions
Q1.1 
Write a CREATE TABLE statement for the Team table, including any foreign keys as necessary.
CREATE TABLE Team(
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(200),
    organization VARCHAR(200)
);


Q1.2 


Write a CREATE TABLE statement for the Contestant table, including any foreign keys as necessary.


CREATE TABLE Contestant(
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    tid INT REFERENCES Team(id),
    name VARCHAR(200),
    birthyear INT
);




Q1.3 


Write a query to return the names of all contestants on the “Track” team for the “University of Washington” organization. Order them alphabetically ascending.


SELECT C.name
FROM Team T, Contestant C
WHERE T.id = C.tid
    AND T.Name = 'Track'
    AND T.organization = 'University of Washington'
ORDER BY C.name ASC;




Q1.4


Write a query to return the id and name of all events that had more than one winner (based on the won attribute).


SELECT E.id, E.name
FROM Event AS E, Performance AS P
WHERE P.eid = E.id AND 
   P.won = 1
GROUP BY E.id, E.name
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2;




Q1.5 


True or False:
These two queries are equivalent:


SELECT m.name, COUNT(*) AS num
FROM Meet m, Event e
GROUP BY m.id, m.name;


SELECT m.name, COUNT(e.id) AS num
FROM Meet m, Event e
GROUP BY m.id, m.name;


Answer:
True (for this instance with no NULL values. In the general case it is false so we gave full credit for both answers.)






















Q1.6
For each meet, find the event with the shortest completion time of the winner. In case of a tie (if multiple events had the same minimal completion time), return all of them. Return the meet name, meet year, event name, and completion time.
(A subquery is not required, though you may use one if you wish.)




Example without subquery:


SELECT m.name, m.year, e1.name, p1.time
FROM Meet m, Event e1, Performance p1, Event e2, Performance p2
WHERE e1.mid = e2.mid AND
      m.id = e1.mid AND
      e1.id = p1.eid AND
      p1.won = 1 AND
      m.id = e2.mid AND
      e2.id = p2.eid AND
      p2.won = 1
GROUP BY m.year, m.name, e1.name, e2.mid, p1.time
HAVING p1.time = MIN(p2.time);


Example with Subquery:


WITH Mintimes AS
   (SELECT m1.id, e1.name, MIN(p1.time) AS mintime
        FROM Event e1, Performance p1, Meet m1
        WHERE e1.id = p1.eid AND
              m1.id = e1.mid
        GROUP BY m1.id)
SELECT m.name, m.year, e.name, mt.mintime
FROM Event AS e, Meet AS m, Performance AS p, Mintimes AS mt
WHERE m.id = mt.id AND
      p.eid = e.id AND
          p.time = mt.mintime;






Q2.1
SQL is a declarative language, meaning we declare what results we want rather than how to calculate them.
True
Q2.2
In SQL, a Primary Key must be only one attribute.
False


Q 2.3
In SQL, each relation can have at most one foreign key reference to another table.


False






Q 2.4
Some database systems may implement the SQL language differently, eg. throwing errors in some cases or not.
True
