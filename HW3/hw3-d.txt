I found that when I created a bigger table, it took lots of time to build. 
I think it is because it needs to be distributed or copied to several servers so
later on when I need to query on something, it can help speed up by seperated these tasks to several severs 
if that query requires multiple servers to work together.

Local machine works faster on easier queries while Azure is good at complicated queries.

I think the idea of offering a DBMS in a public cloud is good that we can store data without redundancy 
and we can modify them together so everyone could get real-time data but we also need to worry about what if someone
accidentally delete something or make some unrecoverable actions.
